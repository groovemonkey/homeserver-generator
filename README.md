# Homeserver Config Generator

Setting up a home server to run basic self-hosted applications shouldn't take 3 servers and a kubernetes cluster. That stuff is great to play and learn with, but sometimes you just want to set up some applications with a minimum of fuss :-).

That's where this repo comes in!


## TODO
- *arr: use the configs from my other real config to double check
- separate config and data directories/volumes mounted into containers (add mounts)
- add prowlarr to sync indexer between *arr apps
- add some first-setup instructions for included apps (link to existing instructions, don't replicate them here. I don't want to have to keep things in sync)
